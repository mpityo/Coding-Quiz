# Coding Quiz
Complete a quiz of questions supplied from file. User has a certain amount of time to finish (number of questions * 8 seconds), and every incorrect answer subtracts 10 seconds from overall time.
<br><br>
User may then add their score to a list of local high scores. Score is calculated by:<br>
Amount of time left + number of questions answered correctly
<br>
